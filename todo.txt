-Javascript backend: when user signs in, fetch the fares for his flights and display that info
-Python backend: convert checkUserFares.py to get user Fares from mongo db and scrape prices. Then cron to run.

#Many Fare Scraping
-debug dynamo db memory error 
-re-enable daily cron 
-maybe: transfer old mongo to new dynamo (only one weeks worth of data)
