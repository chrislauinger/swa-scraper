
Short list todo:  
why are some flights not showing up? (2-3hrs)
admin mode: be able to see everyones flights (2-3hrs)
if price drops further - send another email (2-3hrs) (written need to test)
when entering flight info, after date/route entered -> pull up flight numbers/times/prices options - (10-20hrs) (+ be able to add multiple flights at once)
 -- need to figure out modal
 -- must add button - will need to scrape first 
Remove auto check in and reference to FAQ (1hr)
