
Short list todo:  

when entering flight info, after date/route entered -> pull up flight numbers/times/prices options - (10-20hrs) (+ be able to add multiple flights at once)
 -- need to figure out modal
 -- must add button - will need to scrape first 
scrape into smaller DB (2 hrs) 
create sequenctional version of run user fares (took 38min?)

Scraping every 3 hours:
This buys me about 5k userflights (currently at 1k) assuming each scrape is 2seconds
To speed up: queue a spider with multiple route/date combos to iterate over (5-10x speedup)

Next Release: 
E2E testing
Web Security of connection
Error validation: check if a user has a flight but no fares found. 
Daily full scrpe: currently disabled, is this only getting the last date? (maybe never re-enable due to storage/scraping southwest) (make sure its storing midnight datetime)
