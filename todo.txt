#Displaying user flights:
-javascript + python: make flight key for userBookedFlight and Fare that identifies a flight (date + flight number + route) 
-Javascript backend: when user signs in, fetch the fares for his flights and display that info
-Python backend: convert checkUserFares.py to get user Fares from mongo db and scrape prices. Then cron to run.
-Javascript backend: live edit user booked flights? 

#Many Fare Scraping
-debug dynamo db memory error 
-re-enable daily cron 
-maybe: transfer old mongo to new dynamo (only one weeks worth of data)
